                <h3>Uttarakhand</h3>
                <h3>Land of the Gods</h3>
                <p>Land of untouched natural beauty and spirituality, Uttarakhand is a Himalayan state of North India, famously known as Devbhumi (or the Land of the Gods). Carved out from Uttar Pradesh, the state, formerly known as Uttaranchal, is a place that not only boasts of a scintillating view of the Himalayas but also exhibits a cultural ethos which speaks of a harmonic coexistence with nature.Uttarakhand is a popular pilgrimage site, as it is the originating spot of the Ganga and the Yamuna, two of the most sacred rivers for Hindus. Uttarakhand is home to the Char Dhams, the four most holy sites of pilgrimage revered by the Hindus - Gangotri, Yamunotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath. Thousands of tourists visit Uttarakhand annually to pay homage to the Char Dhams. With oaks, birches, silver firs and rhododendrons adorning the steep mountain slopes, Uttarakhand offers you a glimpse into an untainted and idyllic world.</p>
                <p>Devbhoomi Uttarakhand is the state in India one can easily fall in love with. The surreal landscape that comprises lofty Himalayas, glistening streams, eye-catching meadows, imposing glaciers and surreal lakes, all make Uttarakhand a coveted tourist destination in Indian Himalayas. The state is divided into two regions: Garhwal and Kumaon. Each of these offers plenty of opportunities for tourism, sightseeing, adventure and wildlife. Dotted with sacred Hindu temples and trekking trails, this North Indian state is a travel destination where along with seeking the blessing of the Almighty, one can indulge in adventure and recreational activities.</p>

                    <h1 class="faq-text">Uttarakhand is also referred to as Dev Bhoomi or the 'Land of Gods' because many Hindu pilgrimage spots are located here. The state has been ruled by the Kushanas, Kudinas, Kanishka, Samudra, Guptas, Pauravas, Katuris, Palas, Chandras, Pawaras and the British. After Independence, the Tehri princely state was merged into Uttar Pradesh state, while Uttarakhand composed the Garhwal and Kumaon Divisions. Until 1998, Uttarakhand was the name most commonly used to refer to the region. People belonging to both the regions- Garhwal and Kumaon began agitating for a separate state. Rampur Tiraha firing case on the night of October 1, 1994, led to public uproar and eventually to the division of the state of Uttar Pradesh in 2000. The term Uttaranchal came into use when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) initiated a new round of State Reorganisation in 1998 and introduced its preferred name. However, many controversies took place even after this. Nevertheless, the name Uttarakhand remained popular in the region.</h1>
